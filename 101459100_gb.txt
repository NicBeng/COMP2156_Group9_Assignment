George Brown College is a public college in Toronto, Canada, 
established in 1967. It offers practical programs in fields 
like arts, business, health sciences, and trades. 
The college focuses on giving students real-world experience 
through internships and co-op placements. It's located in the 
city center, making it easy for students to get around and 
experience urban life while studying.

Currently, I am in the program "Computer Systems Technician".
